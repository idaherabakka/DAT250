Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how you resolved
- installation went smoothly, but i could not open the exe-file via termial, s√• i had to run it via file explorer.
- error when checking sha. did not add the whole content for the .sha file so the sha verification didn not work until i fixed the file name and content

Screenshots for:

- The correct validation of the installation package (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/)

- Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant from each CRUD operation).
